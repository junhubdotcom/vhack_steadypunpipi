# Overview

The Watcher leverages IoT, crowdsourcing, and AI-powered real-time data analytics to enhance public administration and urban mobility. IoT sensors and CCTV continuously monitor city conditions, detecting issues such as potholes, fallen trees, and broken streetlights. AI-powered image recognition enables quick reporting by classifying and prioritizing citizen reports based on urgency and severity, which are further verified through public voting and IoT data. This combined approach supports real-time risk assessment, ensuring swift responses to critical incidents. Integrated with navigation apps, the system delivers dynamic hazard alerts, while a structured report list with status updates promotes transparency and community engagement. Governments can track city-wide data through a dashboard that provides insights on issue types, report volumes, graphical analysis, and heatmaps. By automating issue detection and response, The Watcher strengthens urban resilience, optimizes resource allocation, and improves traffic flow.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Source Data Collection and AI-Powered Urban Monitoring
The Watcher integrates data from citizen reports, CCTV, and IoT sensors to monitor city conditions in real-time. AI-powered image recognition automatically categorizes reported issues, while traffic slowdown detection prompts users to submit reports for better accuracy. Government-owned CCTV footage is also analyzed for comprehensive infrastructure monitoring. The system provides real-time updates, enabling authorities to take proactive maintenance actions.

### 2. Real-Time Alerts
The Watcher provides hands-free voice alerts for drivers about road hazards such as potholes, fallen trees, and blocked street signs in Driving Mode, while Walking Mode alerts pedestrians to safety risks like broken streetlights and damaged sidewalks. By seamlessly integrating with Google Maps and Waze, it ensures users receive timely, context-aware notifications without disrupting their activity.

### 3. AI-Driven Risk Assessment and Crowdsourcing Prioritization
By using AI, reported issues are classified and prioritized based on severity, urgency, and potential hazards. A public voting system allows users to validate reports by upvoting, downvoting, or adding details, ensuring more accurate assessments. This approach helps authorities allocate resources efficiently, address critical problems first, and transition from reactive to proactive urban management.

### 4. Issue Tracking and Community Engagement
A transparent issue tracking system updates statuses, including "Reported," "Under Review," "In Progress," and "Completed," ensuring accountability and visibility. The public voting system enables users to verify resolutions, enhancing trust and accuracy. To drive engagement, the platform incorporates gamification elements like badges and rewards, encouraging citizens to actively report issues and contribute to a safer, more efficient, and sustainable urban environment.
